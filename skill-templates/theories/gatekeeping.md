# Gatekeeping Theory

## Core Concept

Gatekeepers control information flow by selecting what content passes through channels to reach audiences.

## Evolution of Gatekeeping

| Era | Model | Key Actors | Control Mechanism |
|-----|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Traditional** | White (1950) | Editors | Selection of stories |
| **Networked** | Barzilai-Nahon (2008) | Multiple actors | Network position |
| **Algorithmic** | Napoli (2015) | Platforms | Recommendation systems |

## Operationalizing Gatekeeping

### Network Indicators

| Indicator | What It Suggests | Caution |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **High betweenness** | Bridge between communities | Position ≠ influence |
| **High in-degree** | Receives attention | Passive ≠ active |
| **Brokerage position** | Information control | Structural ≠ behavioral |

### Behavioral Indicators

- **Selective amplification**: Which content gets retweeted
- **Timing control**: Who posts first vs. who amplifies
- **Framing influence**: How topics are presented

## Method-Theory Mapping

| Method | Gatekeeping Application |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Network analysis** | Identify structural gatekeepers via centrality |
| **Content analysis** | Analyze selection criteria |
| **Temporal analysis** | Map information flow sequences |
| **Frame analysis** | How gatekeepers frame issues |

## Key Questions for Your Research

1. **Who are the gatekeepers?**
   - High centrality nodes
   - But verify behaviorally (do they actually filter?)

2. **What are the gates?**
   - Platform affordances
   - Algorithmic curation
   - Community norms

3. **What passes through?**
   - Content characteristics
   - Source credibility
   - Timing factors

4. **What's filtered out?**
   - The hardest to study
   - Requires comparison to potential content

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Central = gatekeeper | Position ≠ function | Verify behavioral filtering |
| Ignoring algorithms | Platform shapes all | Account for algorithmic curation |
| Single metric | Gatekeeping is multidimensional | Multiple indicators |
| Assuming intentionality | May be emergent | Distinguish structural from strategic |

## Integration with CommDAAF

When studying gatekeeping:

1. **Data**: Network + content data required
2. **Method**: Network analysis + content/frame analysis
3. **Validation**: Verify gatekeepers behaviorally
4. **Interpretation**: Distinguish structural position from gatekeeping function
