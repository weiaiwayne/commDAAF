## Chinese LLM Censorship Study (Feb 2026)

### Key Finding: Academic Framing Does NOT Bypass Content Filters

**Hypothesis (DISPROVEN):** CommDAAF's ~2,500 lines of academic methodology could dilute sensitive keywords below detection threshold.

**Reality:** OpenCode's free proxy (`opencode/kimi-k2.5-free`) routes through infrastructure without content filters. Direct API calls to z.ai and Kimi block Xinjiang/Uyghur content regardless of framing.

### Test Results
| API | Direct Prompt | CommDAAF-Wrapped | Free Proxy |
|-----|---------------|------------------|------------|
| z.ai GLM | ❌ BLOCKED | ❌ BLOCKED | ✅ WORKED |
| Kimi | ❌ BLOCKED | ❌ BLOCKED | ✅ WORKED |

### Implications
1. Chinese LLM content filtering is at API layer, not model weights
2. Proxy services create unintended policy gaps
3. Academic framing is not a bypass technique
4. Always verify which API endpoint is being called

### Wayne's OpenCode Config
- `zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7` → Direct z.ai API (paid, filtered)
- `kimi-for-coding/k2p5` → Direct Kimi API (paid, filtered)  
- `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` → OpenCode proxy (free, unfiltered)

## VibePolitics Project (Feb 2026)

### Project Overview
**Codename:** VibePolitics  
**Goal:** Agentic unconventional polling system for 2026 US midterms & Trump presidency  
**Location:** Boston, MA (framing)  
**Academic Target:** Peer-reviewed publication in political science journals

### Architecture
- **4 Autonomous Agents:**
  - PolAgent-A & PolAgent-B (political analysis, debate)
  - EconAgent-A & EconAgent-B (economic analysis, debate)
- **Data Sources:** Polymarket API, Kalshi API, Google Trends
- **Agent Capabilities:** Search for context, decide to act/not act, choose keywords, engage/abstain from debates
- **Transparency:** All reasoning logged and visible

### Key Design Decisions
1. Agents debate and peer-review each other
2. Multi-source data fusion (markets + search trends)
3. Continuous monitoring, not periodic snapshots
4. Frontend modeled after Kalshi.com
5. Academic publication strategy from day one

### Literature Review Findings
- **Prediction markets outperform polls** 74% of the time (Berg et al., 2008)
- **Google Trends adds predictive value** when combined with other sources
- **Multi-agent LLM systems** validated by ElectionSim (14,490 agents)
- **Key methodological innovation:** Track variance, not just levels (Timoneda & Wibbels, 2022)
- **Polymarket specifically** validated for academic research (Chen et al., 2024)

### API Access Confirmed
- Polymarket: `gamma-api.polymarket.com` — works, no auth needed
- Rich metadata: prices, volume, liquidity, spread, price changes

### Project Files
- `projects/vibepolitics/PROJECT_SPEC.md` — Full specification
- `projects/vibepolitics/VibePolitics_Spec_v0.1.pdf` — PDF version
- `projects/vibepolitics/research/LITERATURE_REVIEW.md` — Academic literature review
- `projects/vibepolitics/research/LITERATURE_REVIEW.pdf` — PDF version

### Next Steps
1. Build MVP data pipeline (Polymarket + Kalshi + Google Trends)
2. Implement single agent prototype
3. Expand to four-agent system with debate
4. Develop frontend dashboard
5. Validate against traditional polls

## Communication Research Skill Project (Feb 2026)

### Project Overview
Adapting DAAF (Data Analyst Augmentation Framework) for communication research as an OpenClaw skill package.

**Source repo:** https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf

### Key Deliverables
- Spec document: `projects/comm-research-skill/SPEC_DRAFT.md`
- Zotero analysis: `projects/comm-research-skill/ZOTERO_ANALYSIS.md`

### Wayne's Research Focus (from Zotero)
- Agentic AI in social science
- Coordinated behavior detection
- Network analysis of movements
- Attention economy
- Zotero ID: 6345227

### Key Selling Point
**Multi-model architecture** — different models for different tasks:
- Cost: ~$5-15 vs DAAF's $30-60
- Epistemic diversity
- Vendor independence

## CommDAAF Cross-Agent Research (Feb 2026)

### Experiment Summary
First full autonomous research workflow: GLM-4.7 and Kimi K2.5 independently analyzed 3,153 tweets (@EastLosHighShow, 2014-2018), then cross-reviewed each other.

### Key Findings
- **Hashtags strongest predictor**: 3.5-3.8x engagement, δ=0.40 (medium effect)
- **Sentiment NOT predictive**: ρ = -0.03 to -0.08 (contradicts common assumptions)
- **2016 organic peak**: Real engagement growth before platform algorithm changes
- **2017 DACA anomaly**: Political content spike, not organic growth

### Methodological Lessons
- Effect sizes need proper classification (Cohen 1988 benchmarks)
- Multiple comparisons require correction (Bonferroni)
- Post-hoc categorizations should be flagged
- 4+ year datasets need temporal periodization

### CommDAAF Audit Grade: C+
Good on conceptual validity; missed temporal skew, engagement normalization, content controls.

### Files
- `projects/comm-research-skill/ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md` (GLM)
- `projects/comm-research-skill/ANALYSIS_RESULTS_KIMI.md` (Kimi)
- `/tmp/kimi-version/comm-daaf/CRITICAL_PM_REVIEW.md` (cross-review)
