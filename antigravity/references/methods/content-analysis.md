## Probing Questions (ALL REQUIRED)

```
Q1: Where's your codebook?
    ✓ Written before coding begins
    ✓ Includes definitions, examples, decision rules
    ✗ "We'll develop it as we go" — NO

Q2: How many coders and reliability plan?
    ✓ Minimum 2 coders
    ✓ Overlap sample (10-20%)
    ✓ Calculate inter-coder reliability
    ✗ "I'll code it myself" — UNACCEPTABLE FOR PUBLICATION

Q3: Sampling strategy?
    ✓ Random sampling
    ✓ Stratified sampling
    ✓ Systematic sampling
    ✗ "Whatever's available" — DOCUMENT SELECTION

Q4: Training protocol?
    ✓ Coder training sessions
    ✓ Practice coding with feedback
    ✓ Pre-reliability check
    ✗ "Just follow the codebook" — INSUFFICIENT

Q5: Ambiguous cases?
    ✓ Decision rules documented
    ✓ Escalation to senior coder
    ✓ Flag for discussion
    ✗ "Use your judgment" — NOT REPLICABLE

Q6: Documentation for replication?
    ✓ Codebook published
    ✓ Sampling procedure documented
    ✓ Reliability statistics reported
```

## Reliability Standards

| Measure | Formula | Acceptable |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Cohen's κ** | Accounts for chance | κ ≥ 0.7 |
| **Krippendorff's α** | Multiple coders, missing data | α ≥ 0.8 |
| **% Agreement** | Simple overlap | Not recommended alone |

## Codebook Template

```markdown
## Variable: [VARIABLE NAME]

**Definition**: [Clear definition]

**Categories**:
1. [Category A]: [Definition]. Example: "[example]"
2. [Category B]: [Definition]. Example: "[example]"

**Decision Rules**:
- If [ambiguous case], code as [X]
- If [edge case], code as [Y]

**Examples**:
- "[example text]" → Code: [A]
- "[example text]" → Code: [B]
```

## Critical Checks

- [ ] Codebook exists BEFORE coding
- [ ] 2+ coders with overlap
- [ ] Reliability calculated (κ ≥ 0.7 or α ≥ 0.8)
- [ ] Training protocol documented
- [ ] Ambiguous cases have decision rules
