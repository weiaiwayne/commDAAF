          "We had three different AI systems (Claude, GLM, and Kimi) independently categorize each tweet by its \"frame\"—is it expressing solidarity, reporting facts, calling for action, etc.? When the AIs agreed, we were more confident in the categorization.",
          "The surprising finding: tweets that simply reported facts (\"Protests spread to 50 cities\") got nearly 3x more engagement than emotional solidarity posts (\"We stand with Iranian women\"). This challenges the common belief that emotional content always spreads best.",
          "Why might this be? In a crisis where the government controls information and spreads disinformation, people desperately need facts. Factual updates become valuable precisely because they're scarce. Emotional support is abundant; reliable information is not.",
          "We wrote up our findings in two papers—one about the content findings, one about the research method itself. We also created a detailed guide so others can replicate this kind of AI-assisted research."
