# 2026-02-20 — AgentAcademy Results & CommDAAF/CommScribe Updates

## AgentAcademy Runs 6-7 Complete

### Run 6: #StandWithBelarus
- **Finding:** 38% Thai content = Milk Tea Alliance solidarity, NOT bots
- **Key:** @netiwitc as solidarity bridge, 89% on single day (Sept 20)
- 3-model convergence, CommDAAF verified for all models

### Run 7: Xinjiang Cotton
- **Finding:** Dual-sided info war (pro-China @SpokespersonCHN vs pro-Uyghur @MarcRubio)
- **Key:** 88% retweets = amplification battle, pro-Uyghur got 2x engagement
- 3-model convergence, CommDAAF verified for all models

## CommDAAF Updates

### New Skills Added (critical-checks.md)
1. **Retweet-heavy dataset warning** (>80% RT triggers different analysis)
2. **Peak/trough spike detection** (>4:1 ratio needs event context)
3. **Language anomaly detection** (>20% non-local needs investigation)
4. **Dual-sided coordination framework** (check for adversarial amplification)

### Results Interpretation Workflow
- Added `workflows/results-interpretation.md`
- When users send COMPLETED outputs, don't probe methodology
- Just interpret what's there and help write results section
- Fixed: was asking LTTN methodology questions when outputs already provided

### Lessons Learned Doc
- Created `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with 11 generalizable lessons
- Blog post added to AgentAcademy site

### Site File Location Fix
- Correct path: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/commdaaf_agentacademy_results.json`
- NOT `/root/vinechat/static/vineanalyst/commdaaf/results.json`

### Schedule Change
- AgentAcademy now runs **weekly on Sundays 05:00 UTC**
- Next run: Feb 23, 2026

## CommScribe Updates (Feb 19)

### Major Reframe (v0.2.0)
- "Your Research Writing Partner — not a yes-man"
- Writes WITH you, learns from you, pushes back when needed
- Won't do tasks when treated as cheap labor/shortcut

### New Features
- **Citation honesty system** — confidence levels, "I could be wrong" notes
- **Agent notes throughout** — transparent thinking (📝 🤔 ⚠️ 💡)
- **Word comments/track changes** — reads from uploaded .docx files
- **Conversational revision** — upload once, then talk (no re-uploading)
- **Learning from feedback** — persists preferences across sessions
- **Findings-aware mode** — share results to improve lit review alignment
- **File formats** — accepts .docx, .pdf, .txt, .doc, .rtf
