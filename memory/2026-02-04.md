# 2026-02-04 / 2026-02-05 Session Notes

## VibePolitics Progress

### Key Reframe (Feb 5)
**Goal is NOT prediction — it's SIGNAL DETECTION**
- Detect unusual signals indicating public opinion shifts
- Not forecasting electoral outcomes
- More novel, less crowded academic space

### Literature Review Completed
- Conducted comprehensive academic literature search
- 18+ papers from Google Scholar, arXiv
- Key findings documented in `projects/vibepolitics/research/LITERATURE_REVIEW.md`
- PDF sent to user via Telegram

### Key Verified Papers
1. **Berg et al. (2008)** - International Journal of Forecasting - "Results from a Decade of IEM" - Markets beat polls 74%
2. **Wolfers & Zitzewitz (2004/2006)** - JEP/NBER - Foundational prediction market theory
3. **Zhang et al. (2024)** - arXiv ElectionSim - 14,490 LLM agents simulating US election
4. **Chen et al. (2024)** - Polymarket validation for academic research

### Polymarket API Confirmed Working
- Endpoint: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets`
- No authentication required
- Rich metadata: prices, volume, liquidity, spread, price changes

### Project Files Created
- `projects/vibepolitics/PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Full system architecture
- `projects/vibepolitics/VibePolitics_Spec_v0.1.pdf` - PDF version
- `projects/vibepolitics/research/LITERATURE_REVIEW.md` - Academic citations
- `projects/vibepolitics/research/LITERATURE_REVIEW.pdf` - PDF version

### Claude Code Session
- Session `oceanic-prairie` was running exhaustive academic search
- Output target: `PREDICTION_MARKETS_STUDIES.md`
- Status: Check on next session

### PADS Signal Framework Designed
- Price velocity tracking
- Volume surge ratio
- Cross-market divergence detection
- Spread change monitoring

## Monthly Research Cron
- Cron job ID: `8134dd36-dabb-45d7-9dd8-06dc13e4e7ba`
- Purpose: Monthly OpenClaw + social science research reports
- Delivery: PDF via Telegram

### Realistic Methodology (Feb 5)
Created data-grounded methodology based on actual API availability:

**Confirmed Data Sources:**
- Polymarket API ✅ (no auth, working)
- Google Trends ✅ (via pytrends)
- Kalshi ❌ (needs auth, excluded from MVP)

**6 Novel Signal Algorithms:**
1. Spread Dynamics Index (SDI) - spread changes = uncertainty
2. Volume Surge Ratio (VSR) - 24hr vs weekly volume
3. Price Velocity Index (PVI) - momentum acceleration
4. Search Variance Spike (SVS) - erratic search = opinion flux
5. Regional Divergence Score (RDS) - states searching differently
6. Market-Search Divergence (MSD) - markets vs public attention

**Simplified Agent System:**
- 2 agents (not 4): Alpha (bullish) + Beta (skeptical)
- Agent disagreement itself is a signal

**Project Files:**
- `METHODOLOGY.md` - Full theoretical framework
- `METHODOLOGY_REALISTIC.md` - Data-grounded implementation

## Peer Review Skill Created & Tested (Feb 5)

### Skill: `peer-review`
Location: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/peer-review/`
- 5-agent multi-model review system via OpenRouter
- Models: DeepSeek V3.2, Kimi K2.5, Gemini 3 Flash, Grok 4.1, Qwen3 VL Thinking
- Perspectives: Methodologist, Theorist, Empiricist, Skeptic, Integrator

### First Test: OpenClaw Social Science Report
**Result:** Report has critical issues
- Unsourced performance claims (80%, 5x)
- Suspicious/fabricated citations
- Marketing material framed as research
- Confidence range: 25-85% (high variance)

**Files:**
- `PEER_REVIEW_SYNTHESIS.md` — Full synthesis
- `PEER_REVIEW_SYNTHESIS.pdf` — PDF version

### OpenRouter API Key
Stored securely at: `~/.openclaw/secrets/openrouter.key`

## VibePolitics Methodology Peer Reviewed (Feb 5)
**5-model peer review of METHODOLOGY_REALISTIC.md**
- Average confidence: 64%
- Key critique: Arbitrary thresholds (need calibration against historical data)
- Concern: "100K gamblers ≠ public opinion" — representativeness gap
- Strength: Novel signal framework, transparent reasoning

### Validation Protocol Created
`projects/vibepolitics/research/VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- 5 experimental studies designed
- Pre-registered success thresholds:
  - Precision >50%
  - Recall >30%
  - Lead time >2 days before polls
  - Granger causality p<0.05

### Full Paper Generated
`VIBEPOLITICS_FULL_PAPER.pdf` (28 pages)
- Combines: lit review + methodology + validation protocol
- Fixed md-to-pdf.mjs converter issues

## 5 Specialist Agent Personas (Feb 5)
For peer review and future multi-agent work:
| Name | Role | Model | Question |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Kenji 🔬 | Methodologist | DeepSeek V3.2 | "Is the process sound?" |
| Priya 📚 | Theorist | Kimi K2.5 | "What's the big picture?" |
| Wei 📊 | Empiricist | Gemini 3 Flash | "What does the data say?" |
| Arjun 🔥 | Skeptic | Grok 4.1 Fast | "What could go wrong?" |
| Mei 🔗 | Integrator | Qwen3 VL Thinking | "How does it fit together?" |

Workspaces configured at `~/.openclaw/workspace-{name}/`

## Slack Integration (Pending)
- Workspace: lampbotics
- App-level token stored: `~/.openclaw/secrets/slack/agents.json`
- **Blocked:** Need bot token (`xoxb-...`) from OAuth & Permissions page
- Plan: Option A — Single bot with prefixed messages for different personas

## Next Steps
1. Get Slack bot token from user (OAuth & Permissions page)
2. Complete Slack integration
3. Collect 4 weeks baseline Polymarket/Trends data
4. Run retrospective 2024 validation (Study 1)
5. Calibrate thresholds against historical data
