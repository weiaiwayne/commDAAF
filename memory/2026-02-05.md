- Created summary CSV: `polymarket_top10_political_2026-02-05.csv`
- Created detailed CSV with sub-markets: `polymarket_top10_detailed_2026-02-05.csv`

### Kalshi Data
- Top 5 political markets saved to: `kalshi_top5_political_2026-02-05.csv`

### Time-Series API Discovery
**Critical finding:** Polymarket CLOB API has working price history endpoint:
```
https://clob.polymarket.com/prices-history?market={token_id}&interval={interval}&fidelity={fidelity}
```
- `market`: CLOB token ID (long numeric string from market tokens)
- `interval`: "all", "max", "1h"
- `fidelity`: 60 for hourly, 1 for minute-level
- Returns: `{"history": [{"t": timestamp, "p": price}, ...]}`

This enables building proper time-series dataset for VibePolitics!
