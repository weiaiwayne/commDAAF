## VibePolitics Pilot Study - API Access Testing

### Key Finding: Got Called Out for Over-Confidence
User (lampbotics) rightfully called me out for presenting analysis results without showing raw data first. Lesson learned: **show the actual data before interpreting**, don't pretend work is complete when it needs verification.

> "I would rather you telling how difficult to get things done than pretending that you have completed the work."

### API Access Confirmed (Real Tests)

**Polymarket (gamma-api.polymarket.com)**
- ✅ PUBLIC, no API key needed
- 500 active markets, 149 politics-related
- Excellent data: volume, 24h volume, prices, spreads, price changes
- Best source for political signal detection

**Kalshi (api.elections.kalshi.com)**
- ✅ PUBLIC read access, no auth for reading
- API migrated from trading-api.kalshi.com
- 200 open events, 119 politics
- ⚠️ Problem: Many political markets have ZERO 24h volume
- Sports betting dominates their active trading
- Has GDP/Fed rate brackets but low liquidity

### Data Quality Comparison

| Platform | Politics Markets | 24h Activity | Best Use |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Polymarket | 149 | High | Primary source |
| Kalshi | 119 | Low | Secondary (economic indicators) |

### Sample Real Data Fetched

**Polymarket - "Will Trump deport less than 250,000?"**
- Price: Yes 5.5%, No 94.5%
- 24h Volume: $6,349
- Total Volume: $1,054,290
- 1-day change: +2.1%

**Kalshi - KXGDP series**
- 4.5% GDP bracket: Yes 16-17¢, Vol $46,401
- Lower liquidity than Polymarket equivalent

### Files Created
- `projects/vibepolitics/pilot/DATA_AVAILABILITY_REPORT.md` - Honest API assessment
- `projects/vibepolitics/pilot/PILOT_STUDY_REPORT.md` - Earlier analysis (needs revision)
- `projects/vibepolitics/pilot/fetch-polymarket.mjs` - Data fetching script
- `projects/vibepolitics/pilot/signal-analysis.mjs` - Signal computation

### Next Steps (User Decision Needed)
1. Re-run pilot with explicit raw data at each step
2. Set up snapshot collection for time-series
3. Focus on Polymarket given Kalshi liquidity issues

### Lesson Learned
Be transparent about what's real vs interpreted. Show raw data first. Don't over-promise.
