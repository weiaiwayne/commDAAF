# 2026-02-22 — Chinese LLM Censorship Investigation

## Summary
Investigated why Chinese LLMs (GLM, Kimi) showed no censorship in AgentAcademy runs vs earlier blocking. **Major finding: it wasn't academic framing bypass — it was the free proxy.**

## Timeline
1. **Feb 18**: Direct API calls to z.ai/Kimi blocked Xinjiang content with HTTP 400
2. **Feb 20+**: Runs used `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` (free proxy tier) — worked
3. **Feb 22**: Discovered the discrepancy, traced to OpenCode provider config

## Key Evidence
- Log analysis: Jan 5 used `providerID=zai-coding-plan` (direct API)
- Feb 20 runs used `providerID=opencode` (free proxy)
- **$0.00 total cost** in runs = free tier confirmation
- Free proxy apparently strips/bypasses content filters

## Model ID Mapping (Wayne's OpenCode config)
| Purpose | Model ID | Type |
|---------|----------|------|
| Direct z.ai | `zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7` | Paid, filtered |
| Direct Kimi | `kimi-for-coding/k2p5` | Paid, filtered |
| Free proxy | `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` | Free, unfiltered |
| Free proxy | `opencode/glm-4.7-free` | Free, unfiltered |

## Paper Status
- **Published**: `papers/ACADEMIC_FRAMING_BYPASS.md` (commits `44b52bf`, `077fe32`)
- **Status**: REQUIRES RETRACTION — hypothesis was based on flawed methodology
- Original claim: CommDAAF's ~2,500 lines of academic methodology dilutes sensitive keywords
- Reality: OpenCode free proxy infrastructure bypasses API content filters

## Action Items
- [x] Document findings in memory
- [ ] Post retraction note with reflection
- [ ] Test with DIRECT API keys to confirm/void bypass hypothesis
- [ ] Update cron job to use direct API model IDs

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify which API endpoint is actually being called
2. Check cost = $0 as a signal for proxy/free tier usage
3. Don't publish findings until methodology is fully validated
4. OpenCode free proxy creates unintended policy gaps for Chinese LLM content filtering

# Nigeria Christian-Fulani Conflict Framing Study

## Overview
Full research study examining how news media frame Christian-Fulani violence in Nigeria, using GDELT + MediaCloud data with multi-model validation.

## Data Collection
- **304 articles** total (GDELT + MediaCloud)
- **38 full-text articles** with stratified sampling by source type
- Sources: Nigerian (Daily Trust, Vanguard, Premium Times), US (NYT, Washington Post, AP, VOA)

## Multi-Model Validation
| Model | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Claude 4.5 Sonnet | ✅ Completed | Primary analysis |
| GLM-4.7 | ✅ Completed | Cross-validated, converged |
| Kimi K2.5 | ❌ BLOCKED | "High risk" content filter triggered |

**Kimi blocking confirms**: Chinese LLM content filters reject academic analysis of religious conflict, not just Xinjiang/Uyghur topics.

## Key Findings (Claude + GLM converged)
1. **Headlines over-represent religious framing**: 60% headlines vs 38% full-text (22% gap)
2. **Economic framing nearly absent**: 2% headlines, 8% full-text
3. **US sources more religious**: 49-57% vs Nigerian 14%
4. **Nigerian sources show more diverse frames**: Land, political, ethnic
5. **Agenda-setting confirmation**: Headline selection amplifies religious conflict narrative

## Hypotheses Tested
- H1: Religious framing dominant (✅ headlines, qualified in full text)
- H2: Economic framing underrepresented (✅ strongly supported)
- H3: US sources more religious (✅ confirmed)
- H4: Framing shifted after 2020 (✅ increase observed)
- H5: Nigerian sources different from international (✅ confirmed - more nuanced)

## Deliverables
- `projects/nigeria-framing-2026/FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `projects/nigeria-framing-2026/analysis/MODEL_COMPARISON.md`
- `projects/nigeria-framing-2026/analysis/FULLTEXT_COMPARISON.md`
- Site: `/root/vinechat/static/vineanalyst/commdaaf/nigeria-framing/`

## Pending
- [ ] Create formal research report with RQs, hypothesis, method section (for Telegram sharing)
- GitHub commit: `c9afaf1` (force push with all study files)
