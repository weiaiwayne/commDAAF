## VibePolitics - Major Data Collection & EDA Complete

### Kalshi API Integration
- Received API credentials from user (then rotated for security)
- Built authenticated client with RSA signature (`projects/vibepolitics/scripts/kalshi_client.py`)
- Downloaded 12 political markets with daily OHLCV data
- Discovered 1,426 political series across 8,346 total

### Extended Polymarket History
- Discovered API now requires `startTs`/`endTs` params (max 14-day window)
- Built chunked downloader to get 6 months of history
- Downloaded 7 markets with 184 days each (Aug 2025 - Feb 2026)
- **No volume per candle** - requires authenticated trades API

### Key EDA Findings

**The Warsh Breakout (Dec 13, 2025)**
- Single-day move: 13% → 35.5% (+173%)
- Preceded by volatility cluster Dec 4-12
- Final price: 95.2% (near-certainty)
- **Signal: Volatility clustering predicts regime changes**

**Cross-Market Correlations**
- Whitmer ↔ Trump Jr: +0.83 (both declining)
- Newsom ↔ Whitmer: -0.65 (substitution effect)
- Shapiro ↔ Warsh: +0.63 (hidden common factor!)

**Market Efficiency**
- Newsom: Momentum (AC = +0.23) - trend-following works
- Trump Jr: Mean-reverting (AC = -0.22) - contrarian works
- Warsh: Efficient (AC = -0.05) - react to news only

**Volume-Price Relationship (Kalshi)**
- High volume days: 3.88% avg move
- Low volume days: 2.04% avg move
- **Signal: Volume as concurrent indicator**

### Pilot Study Paper Written
`projects/vibepolitics/papers/PILOT_STUDY_DRAFT.md`
- Full academic-style paper
- Verified statistics
- 4 actionable signal detection methods
- Pending: news event correlation

### API Limitations Documented
`projects/vibepolitics/data/API_STATUS.md`
- Polymarket: No per-candle volume (needs auth), no comments (needs browser)
- Kalshi: Settled markets purged, no comments available

### Files Created Today
- `projects/vibepolitics/data/timeseries_extended/` - 7 Polymarket 6-month CSVs
- `projects/vibepolitics/data/kalshi/timeseries/` - 12 Kalshi daily CSVs
- `projects/vibepolitics/analysis/EDA_REPORT.md` - Full EDA analysis
- `projects/vibepolitics/papers/PILOT_STUDY_DRAFT.md` - Academic paper draft
- `projects/vibepolitics/scripts/kalshi_client.py` - Authenticated Kalshi client

### Next Steps
1. Correlate key dates with news events (need Brave API key)
2. Build real-time monitoring system
3. Implement agent debate framework
4. Set up automated daily collection
