## VibePolitics: Agent Feedback Synthesis Complete

### All 5 Agent Reviews Retrieved
- **Mei** 🔗 (Integrator): 12 blind spots; warned against over-engineering ML
- **Priya** 📚 (Theorist): 6 blind spots; proposed YAML config layer instead of Layer 0
- **Kenji** 🔬 (Methodologist): 4 blind spots; emphasized feedback loop; 80/20 simpler approach
- **Wei** 📊 (Empiricist): "Regime Change" + "Silent Shift" blind spots; "Computational Grounded Theory" framing
- **Arjun** 🔥 (Skeptic): Trigger fragility, data staleness; practical algo suggestions (Prophet, Isolation Forest, Kalman filter)

Note: Wei and Arjun's replies were in a thread that Slack API couldn't retrieve; user manually sent them.

### Key Document Created
`projects/vibepolitics/research/ARCHITECTURE_SYNTHESIS_AND_PLAN.md`
- Part 1: Feedback synthesis (10 critical blind spots from all agents)
- Part 2: Revised architecture diagram with all suggestions incorporated
- Part 3: 8-week implementation plan (4 phases)
- Part 4: Explicit specs (feature set, escalation rules, LLM prompts)
- Part 5: Academic defensibility strategy
- Part 6: Open questions for team decision

### Critical Design Decisions (Consensus)
1. **No VADER/FinBERT** → Topic-Specific Volatility Z-Scores (Wei)
2. **Layer 0** → Lightweight rule engine, not LLM (Arjun: "Prometheus alerts → webhook")
3. **Daily Hunch Audit** → Agents check even without ML trigger (Wei: catch "boiling frog")
4. **Kalman filter** → Fuse ML signals before LLM escalation (Arjun)
5. **Adaptive thresholds** → Weekly recalibration from Layer 2 findings
6. **5% random sampling** → Catch false negatives (Priya)
7. **Add Historian agent** → Pattern matching ("this rhymes with 2016")

### Academic Framing (Wei)
"Computational Grounded Theory":
- Layer 1 = Automated Discovery (quantitative skeleton)
- Layer 2 = Theoretical Sampling (qualitative muscle)
- Config Layer = Orchestrator (inductive/deductive loop)

### Arjun's Parting Words
> "Ship or it's vapor." 🔥

### Next Steps
1. Phase 1: Collect 2024 historical Polymarket data, backtest ML detectors
2. Phase 2: Build single "senior analyst" LLM MVP
3. Phase 3: Expand to 3-agent system with debate
4. Phase 4: Ablation study + paper writing

### Open Questions (Need Decision)
- Sentiment replacement: Wei's topic z-scores vs. Arjun's zero-shot LLM?
- Daily Hunch Audit frequency: 1x/day or more?
- Real-time data: Add X/Reddit APIs or stick with Google Trends?
