## Major Project: Communication Research Skill for OpenClaw

### Context
Wayne asked me to analyze DAAF (Data Analyst Augmentation Framework) repo and adapt it for communication research. Two tasks assigned at ~04:11 UTC with 09:00 UTC deadline.

**DAAF Repo:** https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf
- Multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code
- 5 phases, 12 stages with per-script QA
- Education data focus (Urban Institute)
- File-first execution, adversarial review

### Task 1: Adapt for Communication Research
- Original DAAF is for education research
- Communication scholars need: social media data, network analysis, text-as-data
- User wants Zotero integration for auto-tuning to researcher's domain

### Task 2: Create portable OpenClaw skill package
- Shareable for scholarly community

### Wayne's Zotero Library (ID: 6345227)
- Key: hdGQHncaNqZ48Bhe0rJGyCnb
- **Focus areas:**
  - Agentic AI in social science research
  - Coordinated behavior detection (Telegram, Facebook)
  - Network analysis of social movements
  - Attention economy & networked publics
  - Artificial sociality & virtual influencers
- Key collections: "AI in Agentic Social Science", "AI Agents", "Agentic Political Communication"
- Key papers: Davidson & Karell (2025) on GenAI integration, Giglietto et al. on coordinated behavior

### Key Selling Point (Wayne's Input)
**Multi-model architecture** — OpenClaw can use different models for different tasks:
- Cost savings (~$5-15 vs DAAF's $30-60)
- Epistemic diversity (different models catch different issues)
- Vendor independence
- This should be prominently featured for academic market

### Files Created
- `projects/comm-research-skill/SPEC_DRAFT.md` — Main spec (~55KB)
- `projects/comm-research-skill/ZOTERO_ANALYSIS.md` — Library analysis
- `projects/comm-research-skill/RESEARCH_NOTES.md` — Working notes

### Skills Added to Spec
Based on Zotero analysis:
1. Telegram data source skill
2. Coordinated behavior detection method
3. Attention metrics skill
4. LLM-based annotation skill

### Data Sources Researched
- Reddit API (PRAW) — accessible
- YouTube Data API — accessible
- TikTok Research API — application required
- Telegram (Telethon) — user studies this
- MediaCloud — 60k+ sources, free
- GDELT — BigQuery, 1979-present
- Bluesky (AT Protocol) — open
- SNAP Stanford — network datasets

### Cron Job Set
- Reminder at 06:00 UTC to check progress
- ID: 31501eca-4274-4379-8b88-2592a573183c

### Status @ 05:20 UTC
- Spec draft complete with domain-specific additions
- Multi-model architecture section added
- Continuing refinement through night
- Deadline: 09:00 UTC
