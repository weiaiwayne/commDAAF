# Attention Economy Framework (Auto-Customized)

*Integrated based on your Zotero library*

## Core Principle

"What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention 
of its recipients." — Herbert Simon

In your research context, attention economy appears in 2 papers.

## Key Concepts

1. **Attention Scarcity**: Finite human attention vs. infinite content
2. **Competition**: Content competes for limited attention
3. **Inequality**: Power-law distribution of attention
4. **Algorithmic Mediation**: Platforms shape attention allocation

## Measurement Approaches

### Platform Metrics as Attention Proxies
- Engagement (likes, shares, comments)
- View counts / impressions
- Watch time / scroll depth
- Click-through rates

### Aggregate Measures
- Attention Gini coefficient (inequality)
- Concentration ratios
- Long-tail analysis

## Research Questions

- How is attention distributed across actors?
- What content features predict attention capture?
- How do algorithms shape attention flows?
- What are consequences of attention inequality?

## Connection to Your Methods

- **Named Entity** (257 papers)
- **Network Analysis** (145 papers)
- **Regression Analysis** (103 papers)
