## A Case Study of @EastLosHighShow on Twitter (2014-2018)

### Research Question
How do entertainment brands use sentiment in social media content to drive audience engagement?

### Data & Methods
- **Dataset**: 3,153 tweets from @EastLosHighShow (Hulu original series account)
- **Time period**: July 2014 - January 2018
- **Sentiment analysis**: TextBlob polarity scores (-1 to +1)
- **Engagement metrics**: Retweet count, favorite count

### Key Findings

**1. Sentiment Distribution**
The account maintains overwhelmingly positive sentiment:
- Positive tweets (polarity > 0.1): 44.8% (n=1,413)
- Neutral tweets: 48.5% (n=1,529)
- Negative tweets (polarity < -0.1): 6.7% (n=211)
- Mean polarity: 0.175 (SD=0.311)

**2. Engagement Patterns**
Total engagement over the study period:
- Retweets: 76,302 (avg 24.2 per tweet)
- Favorites: 49,578 (avg 15.7 per tweet)

**3. Sentiment-Engagement Correlation**
Correlation analysis reveals:
- Polarity × Retweet count: r = -0.010
- Polarity × Favorite count: r = -0.026

This suggests a weak negative relationship between sentiment and engagement.

**4. Temporal Patterns**
Year-over-year sentiment and engagement:

| Year | Mean Polarity | Avg Retweets |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 2014 | 0.152 | 3.5 |
| 2015 | 0.199 | 6.5 |
| 2016 | 0.188 | 32.9 |
| 2017 | 0.183 | 118.8 |
| 2018 | 0.372 | 6.4 |

### Conclusions

1. Entertainment brands strategically maintain positive sentiment (mean polarity = 0.175)
2. Negative content is deliberately minimized (only 6.7% of tweets)
3. The weak sentiment-engagement correlation (r = -0.010) suggests content quality matters more than valence
4. This "positivity bias" represents a calculated brand management strategy

### Implications

Entertainment brands should:
- Maintain predominantly positive sentiment in social media
- Avoid negative content that could damage brand perception
- Focus on content quality over emotional manipulation
