## Insights for Skill Design

### User's Research Focus
The library reveals a highly specific focus on **agentic AI applied to communication research**. This is not traditional computational communication science — it's about:
1. Using AI agents as research tools (what we're building)
2. Studying AI agents as communication phenomena
3. Understanding how AI mediates attention and sociality

### Implications for Skill Package

**Priority Methods:**
1. Coordinated behavior detection
2. Network analysis (temporal, weighted)
3. LLM-based text classification/annotation
4. Cross-platform data integration
5. Agent-based social simulation

**Priority Data Sources:**
1. Telegram (the user studies this)
2. Reddit (accessible API)
3. News media (GDELT, MediaCloud)
4. Alternative platforms (Bluesky, Mastodon)

**Theoretical Integration:**
- Build in attention economy concepts
- Support coordinated behavior analysis workflows
- Include network metrics relevant to influence/diffusion
- Framework for studying AI-mediated communication

**Novel Feature:**
The user's own research on "agentic AI in social science" suggests they want a tool that is:
1. Self-aware about AI's role in research
2. Transparent about AI-human collaboration
3. Reflexive about how AI mediates the research process
