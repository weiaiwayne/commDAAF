# Frame Analysis

## Probing Questions (ALL REQUIRED)

```
Q1: What TYPE of framing?
    ✓ Media frames (how news covers an issue)
    ✓ Audience frames (how people interpret)
    ✓ Strategic frames (how actors influence)
    ✗ "Just frames" — TOO VAGUE

Q2: Inductive or deductive approach?
    ✓ Inductive: Let frames emerge from data
    ✓ Deductive: Apply existing typology (cite it)
    ✗ "Both" without primary — PICK ONE

Q3: Unit of analysis?
    ✓ Article/post
    ✓ Paragraph
    ✓ Sentence
    ✗ "The text" — BE SPECIFIC

Q4: What frame elements will you code?
    ✓ Problem definition
    ✓ Causal attribution
    ✓ Moral evaluation
    ✓ Treatment recommendation
    ✓ All four (Entman's framework)
    ✗ "The framing" — FRAMES HAVE COMPONENTS

Q5: Validation plan?
    ✓ Multiple coders + reliability
    ✓ Citation of established typology
    ✗ "I'll know it when I see it" — UNACCEPTABLE
```

## Entman's Frame Elements

| Element | Question It Answers | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| **Problem definition** | What's the issue? | "Immigration is a crisis" |
| **Causal attribution** | Who/what caused it? | "Government policy failure" |
| **Moral evaluation** | Is it good/bad? | "Inhumane treatment" |
| **Treatment recommendation** | What should be done? | "Build a wall" / "Open borders" |

## Common Frame Typologies

| Domain | Typology | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Generic** | Conflict, Human Interest, Economic, Morality, Responsibility | Semetko & Valkenburg (2000) |
| **Climate** | Scientific, Economic, Political, Risk | Nisbet (2009) |
| **Health** | Epidemic, Scientific, Political, Economic | Dudo et al. (2007) |

## Critical Checks

- [ ] Frame type specified (media/audience/strategic)
- [ ] Approach justified (inductive/deductive)
- [ ] Frame elements defined
- [ ] Inter-coder reliability planned (κ ≥ 0.7)
- [ ] Unit of analysis matches RQ
