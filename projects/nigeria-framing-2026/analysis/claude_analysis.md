# Claude Analysis: Nigeria Christian-Fulani Conflict Framing

**Model:** Claude (Anthropic)  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Dataset:** 304 articles from GDELT + MediaCloud

---

## 1. Frame Prevalence Estimates

Based on analysis of 304 article titles across 30+ sources:

| Frame Type | Estimated Prevalence | Confidence |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Religious Persecution** | 55-60% | High |
| **Violence/Security** | 30-35% | High |
| **State/Government Response** | 15-20% | Medium |
| **Criminal/Banditry** | 10-15% | Medium |
| **Ethnic Conflict** | 5-8% | Medium |
| **Resource/Economic** | 2-3% | High |
| **Climate/Structural** | <1% | High |

### Frame Definitions Applied:
- **Religious Persecution**: Explicit Christian victim framing, persecution language, faith-based targeting
- **Violence/Security**: Attack, kill, kidnap, massacre without explicit religious frame
- **State Response**: Government action, military, policy, sovereignty concerns
- **Criminal/Banditry**: Bandits, gangs, ransom, criminal framing
- **Ethnic**: Farmer-herder, Fulani as ethnic group, tribal references
- **Resource/Economic**: Land, grazing, cattle, livelihood
- **Climate/Structural**: Drought, desertification, migration drivers

## 2. Hypothesis Assessment

### H1: Religious framing dominates over economic/structural framing
**✅ STRONGLY SUPPORTED**

Evidence:
- Religious persecution frame: ~55-60% of coverage
- Economic/structural frame: ~2-3%
- Ratio: ~20:1 religious to economic
- Key indicators: "Christian persecution," "massacre of Christians," "religious freedom," "jihadist," "Islamist"

Almost no headlines mention land disputes, grazing routes, climate migration, or resource competition—the actual structural drivers of conflict.

### H2: Fulani receive more blame than structural factors
**✅ STRONGLY SUPPORTED**

Evidence:
- "Fulani" appears primarily as aggressor: "Fulani kill," "Fulani militants," "Fulani herdsmen attack"
- Structural attribution (climate, land policy, government failure) nearly absent
- When government blamed, framed as inaction on religious persecution, not policy failure

Exception: Nigerian sources (punchng.com, thisdaylive.com) occasionally reference grazing policy and structural issues.

### H3: Christians portrayed as victims more than Fulani
**✅ STRONGLY SUPPORTED**

Evidence:
- Christians as victims: "Christians killed," "Christians kidnapped," "persecution of Christians" - dominant frame
- Fulani as victims: Only 2 articles (MACBAN statement about attacks on herdsmen)
- Ratio: ~50:1 Christian victim to Fulani victim portrayal

Notable: No coverage of violence against Fulani communities or state violence against herders.

### H4: Conservative/religious sources show stronger religious framing
**✅ SUPPORTED**

Evidence by source type:
- **Conservative US** (Breitbart, Fox, Daily Caller, Daily Signal, Townhall): 80-90% religious framing
- **Religious media** (Christian Post, NCRegister, Catholic World Report): 95%+ religious framing
- **Mainstream US** (Newsweek, Seattle Times, ABC): 60-70% religious framing
- **Nigerian sources** (Punch, Sahara, ThisDay): 40-50% religious framing

Conservative outlets use explicit persecution language ("genocide," "slaughter," "obliteration") at higher rates.

### H5: Nigerian sources show more diverse framing
**✅ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

Evidence:
- Nigerian sources include: grazing policy debate, sovereignty concerns, internal political critique
- Examples from Punch: "Why Nigeria Must Immediately Transition to Modern Ranching," "US Airstrikes: Implications for Sovereignty"
- Examples from ThisDay: "Denial, Dereliction and Mass Distress" (governance critique)

However:
- Nigerian sources still predominantly use violence frame
- Some Nigerian sources (Sahara Reporters) match US conservative religious framing
- Sample size for Nigerian sources is smaller (n=40 vs n=150 US)

## 3. Source Comparison

### Conservative US Sources (Breitbart, Fox, Daily Signal, Daily Caller, Townhall)
**n ≈ 75 articles (~25%)**

Dominant frames:
- Religious persecution (primary)
- Trump administration response
- International intervention
- Genocide/existential threat language

Characteristic language: "slaughter," "massacre," "genocide," "jihadist," "ISIS-linked," "obliteration"

### Religious Media (Christian Post, NCRegister, Catholic World Report)
**n ≈ 15 articles (~5%)**

Dominant frames:
- Religious persecution (near-exclusive)
- Papal/Vatican response
- Christmas attack warnings
- Prayer/faith response

Characteristic language: "persecution," "martyrdom," "faith," "church attacks"

### Mainstream US (Newsweek, ABC, Seattle Times, Reuters)
**n ≈ 35 articles (~12%)**

Dominant frames:
- Violence/security (primary)
- Policy/political (Trump actions)
- Religious persecution (secondary)

More likely to include: context, Nigerian government perspective, complexity acknowledgment

### Nigerian Sources (Punch, Sahara, ThisDay, Daily Trust, Daily Post)
**n ≈ 40 articles (~13%)**

Dominant frames:
- Violence/security
- Governance failure
- Policy debate (grazing, ranching)
- Sovereignty concerns

More likely to include: structural factors, internal critique, nuanced actor portrayal

### Wire Services (Reuters, AP)
**n ≈ 5 articles (~2%)**

Dominant frames:
- Factual reporting
- Both sides acknowledgment
- Less inflammatory language

## 4. Key Patterns

### Pattern 1: Trump Administration as Frame Driver
~30% of articles reference Trump administration actions (airstrikes, threats, troop deployment). US policy response has become a major framing device, potentially overshadowing Nigerian agency.

### Pattern 2: Christmas Attack Warnings
Multiple sources predicted "Christmas massacre" - suggests coordinated messaging from advocacy groups or shared sourcing.

### Pattern 3: Kidnapping as Dominant Event Type
~40% of articles reference kidnappings, particularly church abductions. This event type may be over-represented relative to other violence forms.

### Pattern 4: Nicki Minaj Effect
Celebrity advocacy (Nicki Minaj praising Trump on Nigeria) appears in multiple outlets, suggesting celebrity framing influences news agenda.

### Pattern 5: Source Echo Chamber
Similar headlines across conservative outlets suggest shared sourcing (possibly same advocacy groups, press releases, or wire copy).

### Pattern 6: Nigerian Counter-Narrative
Nigerian sources include perspectives absent from US coverage:
- Fulani community claims of victimization (MACBAN)
- Sovereignty concerns about US intervention
- Grazing policy as solution (vs. military intervention)

## 5. Limitations

1. **Title-Only Analysis**: Headlines may not reflect full article content; body text could contain more nuance.

2. **Sample Bias**: 
   - MediaCloud US National collection over-represents US conservative sources
   - Nigerian sources under-represented
   - Wire services minimally present

3. **Time Period**: Nov 2025 - Feb 2026 may not be representative; includes Christmas attack cycle and Trump policy actions.

4. **Coding Subjectivity**: Frame identification based on keyword/phrase detection; edge cases exist.

5. **Missing Frames**: 
   - Gender dimension (women/children as victims) not coded
   - Historical context frame not measured
   - International relations frame beyond US not captured

6. **Source Classification**: Some sources may be miscategorized; "conservative" vs "mainstream" is contested.

---

## 6. Conclusions

The dataset reveals **systematic over-representation of religious persecution framing** in international (especially US) coverage of the Nigeria conflict. Economic/structural factors (land, climate, resource competition) are nearly invisible despite being central to the actual conflict dynamics.

This framing pattern:
- Aligns with US domestic political narratives about religious freedom
- Serves advocacy group messaging
- May distort policy responses toward military intervention rather than structural solutions
- Ignores complexity of farmer-herder conflicts across the Sahel

Nigerian sources provide partial corrective but are under-represented in the global information ecosystem.
