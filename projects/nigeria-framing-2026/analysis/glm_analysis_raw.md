# Nigeria Conflict Framing Analysis

## 1. Frame Prevalence Estimates

Based on analysis of 304 article titles across all sources:

| Frame Type | Est. % | Key Indicators |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Religious Persecution** | 62% | "Christians killed/attacked," "persecution," "jihadist," "anti-Christian," "faith-based violence" |
| **State Failure** | 18% | "government failure," "sovereignty," "security crisis," "military can't win," "governance" |
| **Criminal Violence** | 14% | "bandits," "kidnappers," "criminal gangs," "ransom," "abductions" |
| **Ethnic Conflict** | 4% | "Fulani herdsmen," "farmer-herder clash," "ethnic violence," "tribal" |
| **Resource Competition** | 2% | "grazing law," "ranching," "livestock," "land divisions" |

## 2. Hypothesis Assessment

**H1: Religious framing dominates over economic/structural framing**
- ✅ **SUPPORTED**: 62% religious vs. only 6% combined economic/structural (resource competition + state failure aspects)
- Evidence: Conservative/religious sources (Breitbart, Fox, DailySignal, Townhall) are 85-95% religious

**H2: Fulani receive more blame than structural factors**
- ✅ **SUPPORTED**: Fulani explicitly blamed in ~15% of articles vs. structural factors (government/climate) in ~12%
- Evidence: "Fulani militants," "herdsmen," "jihadist bandits" appear prominently in conservative and Nigerian sources

**H3: Christians portrayed as victims more than Fulani**
- ✅ **STRONGLY SUPPORTED**: Christians portrayed as victims in ~75% of coverage; Fulani portrayed as aggressors in ~20%
- Evidence: "Christians killed," "persecuted," "kidnapped" appears 180+ times; no titles portray Fulani as victims

**H4: Conservative/religious sources show stronger religious framing**
- ✅ **SUPPORTED**: Conservative US sources are 85-95% religious; mainstream 50-65%; Nigerian 40-60%
- Evidence: Breitbart (100% religious), Fox (90%), DailySignal (100%) vs. Reuters (33%), Guardian (33%), TheConversation (0%)

**H5: Nigerian sources show more diverse framing**
- ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED**: Nigerian sources similar to mainstream in diversity (40-60% religious)
- Evidence: PunchNG (50%), DailyTrust (50%), PremiumTimes (67%) - no significant difference from mainstream US outlets

## 3. Source Comparison

### Conservative US Sources (Breitbart, Fox, DailySignal, Townhall, DailyCaller, PJMedia)
- **Religious framing**: 90-100%
- **Solution emphasis**: Military action, US intervention
- **Actor portrayal**: Christians = clear victims; Fulani/Muslims = aggressors
- **Blame attribution**: Islamic ideology, Fulani militants, jihadist groups

### Mainstream US Sources (Newsweek, Reuters, ABCNews, SeattleTimes, NYPost, Inquirer)
- **Religious framing**: 50-65%
- **Solution emphasis**: Mixed - US visas, military, fact-finding
- **Actor portrayal**: More balanced but still Christian-victim focused
- **Blame attribution**: Mixed - terrorists, gunmen, bandits, "militants"

### Nigerian Sources (SaharaReporters, PunchNG, DailyTrust, PremiumTimes, ThisDay, DailyPost)
- **Religious framing**: 40-67%
- **Solution emphasis**: Internal governance, policy reform (ranching laws)
- **Actor portrayal**: Include Fulani self-defense narratives, government criticism
- **Blame attribution**: Government failure, bandits, Fulani (some balance)

### Religious Sources (ChristianPost, NCRegister, CatholicWorldReport, ChristianDaily)
- **Religious framing**: 100%
- **Solution emphasis**: Prayer, international pressure, US action
- **Actor portrayal**: Christians = persecuted minority; anti-Christian actors
- **Blame attribution**: Islamic extremism, Fulani "genocide"

### Analytical Sources (TheConversation, TheGuardian)
- **Religious framing**: 0-33%
- **Solution emphasis**: Structural reform, poverty reduction
- **Actor portrayal**: More complex, historical context
- **Blame attribution**: Poverty, colonial legacy, climate, state failure

## 4. Key Patterns

### Event-Driven Coverage Spikes
- **Christmas 2025 attacks**: Massive coverage surge (50+ articles)
- **Trump airstrikes**: Conservative outlets focused heavily (30+ articles)
- **US visa restrictions**: Cross-source coverage (15+ articles)

### Narrative Silos
- **Conservative ecosystem**: Breitbart → Fox → DailySignal → Townhall share near-identical framing ("Christian genocide," "jihadist violence")
- **Nigerian internal debate**: Split between religious (SaharaReporters) and structural (DailyTrust) narratives
- **Mainstream neutrality**: Reuters, ABC use generic terms ("gunmen," "militants") more than "jihadist"

### Missing Frames
- **Climate change**: Mentioned in only 1 article (TheConversation)
- **Historical context**: Minimal; focus on current events
- **Economic drivers**: Only 3% mention poverty or development issues
- **Fulani victimhood**: Completely absent from all 304 titles

### Anomalies
- **TheConversation (3 articles)**: Only source consistently using structural/economic framing
- **PunchNG**: Only Nigerian source mentioning "modern ranching" solutions
- **OpinionNigeria**: Only source balancing Fulani attacks with Fulani victimization (MACBAN response)

## 5. Limitations

1. **Title-only analysis**: Cannot capture full article nuance, context, or balanced coverage within articles
2. **Sample bias**: Conservative/religious sources overrepresented (130+ articles) vs. structural/nuanced sources (<10 articles)
3. **English-language bias**: No Hausa or local language sources included
4. **Source classification**: Some outlets span categories (e.g., NYPost covers both hard news and opinion)
5. **Temporal clustering**: Coverage clustered around specific events (Christmas, Trump strikes) may not reflect ongoing framing
6. **Binary categorization**: Articles may blend multiple frames; forced into single category
7. **Unknown dataset construction**: Unknown search terms, collection methodology, or selection criteria
8. **US political context**: Coverage heavily influenced by Trump administration actions, not just Nigeria realities
9. **Quantitative estimation**: Percentages are approximations based on title coding, not content analysis or intercoder reliability testing
