304 news article titles from various sources (GDELT + MediaCloud, Nov 2025 - Feb 2026).

## Research Questions

2. **Causal Attribution**: Who/what is blamed? (Fulani actors, Islamic ideology, climate/environment, government failure)
3. **Actor Portrayal**: How are Christians vs Fulani portrayed? (victims, aggressors, communities)
