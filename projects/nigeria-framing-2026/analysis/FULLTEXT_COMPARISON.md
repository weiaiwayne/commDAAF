| **Economic** | ~2% | 7.7% | **+6%** |

## Critical Findings

### 1. Nigerian Sources ARE More Balanced
- Religious framing: **14.3%** (vs 49-57% for US sources)
- Economic framing: **19.4%** (vs 2-4% for US sources)
- Climate mentions: **4.6%** (vs <1% for US sources)

**H5 NOW SUPPORTED:** Full text analysis confirms Nigerian sources provide significantly more diverse framing.

### 2. Analytical Sources Provide Structural Context
- TheConversation, Guardian, AllAfrica
- Economic: 17.5% (8x higher than conservative US)
- More ethnic nuance (18.7%)

### 3. US Sources Homogeneous
- Conservative, religious, AND mainstream US sources all show 42-57% religious framing
- Mainstream US (57.3%) actually HIGHER than conservative (49.3%) in full text
- All US sources under 5% economic framing

### 4. Headlines Distort More Than Articles
- Article bodies contain context that headlines omit
- Religious framing drops 22 points when reading full text
- Economic/ethnic content present but not headlined

---

## Articles With Structural Framing

Only 3 articles showed significant economic/climate content:

1. **TheConversation:** "Nigeria has a high poverty rate – what this has to do with ethnic conflicts"
   - Economic: 37 mentions | Climate: 1

2. **Daily Trust (Nigerian):** "Pastoral Challenges And The Misunderstood Conversation"
   - Economic: 31 mentions | Climate: 7

3. **The Guardian:** "US strikes on IS targets in Nigeria may only fan the flames"
   - Economic: 6 | Climate: 4

## Revised Conclusions

### Headline-Only Analysis (n=304)
- Over-estimates religious framing
- Under-represents structural factors
- Useful for studying media framing CHOICES

### Full-Text Analysis (n=38)
- Religious framing still dominant but lower (38% vs 60%)
- Economic content present but buried (7.7%)
- Climate content rare but exists (1.4%)
- Nigerian sources significantly more balanced

### Implications

1. **Headlines are editorial choices** — They emphasize religious angle even when articles contain more nuance

2. **Source selection matters more than thought** — Nigerian/analytical sources provide qualitatively different coverage

3. **Readers who only see headlines** get more distorted view than those who read full articles

4. **Economic/climate framing exists** — but requires seeking Nigerian or analytical sources
