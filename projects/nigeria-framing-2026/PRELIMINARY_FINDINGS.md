| Frame | Articles | Percentage |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Religious** | 52 | 45% |
| **Violence** | 32 | 28% |

### Key Observations

1. **Religious Frame Dominance (45%)**
   - Terms: "Christian," "church," "Muslim," "persecution"
   - Most prominent in Western Christian media outlets
   - Often positions conflict as religious persecution

2. **Violence Frame Secondary (28%)**
   - Terms: "kill," "attack," "massacre"
   - Common across all source types
   - Often combined with religious framing

3. **Ethnic Frame Underrepresented (3%)**
   - Terms: "Fulani," "herder," "farmer"
   - When used, often subordinate to religious narrative
   - Nigerian sources more likely to use ethnic framing

4. **Economic Frame Absent (2%)**
   - Terms: "land," "grazing," "resources"
   - Almost entirely absent from headlines
   - Critical context missing from most coverage

## Hypothesis Assessment (Preliminary)

### H1: Religious Over-framing ✅ SUPPORTED
Western media disproportionately emphasizes religious framing over economic/climate factors.

**Evidence:**
- 45% religious framing vs 2% economic framing
- Christian media outlets (christianpost.com, christiandaily.com, catholicworldreport.com) among top sources
- Headlines like "Massacre of Christians" rather than "Land dispute deaths"

### H2: Nigerian Media Complexity ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT DATA
Nigerian domestic media uses more diverse framing than international outlets.

**Status:** Only 11 Nigerian-source articles collected; need more data for robust comparison.

### H3: Incident-Driven Shifts ⏳ NOT YET TESTED
Religious framing spikes immediately after violence, then diversifies over time.

**Status:** Requires temporal analysis with dated incident data.

---

## Limitations

1. **Sample Size:** 115 articles is preliminary; larger sample needed
2. **GDELT Coverage:** Rolling 3-month window limits historical analysis
3. **Source Bias:** GDELT may overrepresent English-language sources
4. **No MediaCloud Data:** Awaiting API key for triangulation
5. **Headline-Only Analysis:** Full-text analysis would reveal more nuance

1. **MediaCloud Integration:** Obtain API key for source-level comparison
2. **Expand GDELT Collection:** Additional queries for Nigerian sources
3. **Full-Text Analysis:** Extract body text for deeper frame analysis
4. **Temporal Mapping:** Match coverage to specific violent incidents
5. **Source Categorization:** Systematic classification by geography, orientation
