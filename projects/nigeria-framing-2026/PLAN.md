# Nigeria Christian-Fulani Conflict Framing Study

## Overview
Comparative analysis of news framing of Christian-Fulani tensions in Nigeria using GDELT and MediaCloud data.

## Research Questions

### RQ1: Framing Prevalence
How is the Christian-Fulani conflict framed across international news media?
- **Religious frame**: Christian vs. Muslim conflict
- **Ethnic frame**: Farmer vs. herder, ethnic tensions
- **Economic frame**: Resource competition, land disputes
- **Climate frame**: Desertification, migration pressure

### RQ2: Geographic Framing Differences
Do framing patterns differ between:
- Nigerian media
- Western media (US/UK)
- African regional media
- Global/wire services

### RQ3: Temporal Dynamics
How do frames shift around major violent incidents?

## Hypotheses

### H1: Religious Over-framing
Western media disproportionately emphasizes religious framing over economic/climate factors.
*Rationale: Sensationalism, audience expectations, conflict simplification*

### H2: Nigerian Media Complexity
Nigerian domestic media uses more diverse framing than international outlets.
*Rationale: Local context, nuance, multi-stakeholder audiences*

### H3: Incident-Driven Shifts
Religious framing spikes immediately after violence, then diversifies over time.
*Rationale: Breaking news simplification, followed by analytical coverage*

### H4: Source Type Effects
Wire services (AFP, Reuters, AP) use more neutral framing than opinion-focused outlets.

## Data Sources
