## Abstract

What makes protest content go viral? While prior research emphasizes emotional and moral content as drivers of online diffusion, we find that informational framing outperforms emotionally charged frames in predicting viral engagement during the 2022 #MahsaAmini movement. Analyzing 380 Twitter posts from the first two weeks of protests following Mahsa Amini's death, we employ multi-model content analysis to code seven theoretically derived frames. Contrary to expectations from moral contagion theory, INFORMATIONAL framing—neutral updates and factual reporting—showed the strongest association with engagement (IRR = 2.72, p < .001), followed by high emotional arousal (IRR = 1.58, p = .038). SOLIDARITY framing, despite being most prevalent (32%), showed baseline engagement levels. These findings suggest that in information-scarce crisis environments, audiences may prioritize factual orientation over emotional mobilization, with implications for understanding protest dynamics and platform-mediated collective action.

## 1. Introduction

On September 16, 2022, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of Iran's morality police after being detained for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Her death sparked the largest protests in Iran since the 2009 Green Movement, with demonstrations spreading across the country under the slogan "Woman, Life, Freedom" (zan, zendegi, āzādi). Unlike previous Iranian uprisings, the #MahsaAmini movement was characterized by unprecedented social media coordination, with Twitter/X serving as a critical platform for transnational solidarity, information sharing, and protest mobilization (Alinejad, 2023).

The movement presents a compelling case for examining what makes protest content spread. In contexts of state censorship, internet shutdowns, and information scarcity, how do different message frames shape viral diffusion? Does emotional content spread furthest, as moral contagion theory suggests (Brady et al., 2017)? Or do informational frames serve distinct functions in crisis contexts where audiences seek orientation and verification?

This study examines frame effects on viral engagement during the #MahsaAmini movement, contributing to theoretical debates about the relationship between framing and diffusion in networked protest contexts. We analyze 380 Twitter posts stratified across engagement levels, coding content for seven theoretically derived frames and examining their association with composite engagement metrics. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions about emotional content and virality, revealing that informational framing—not emotional appeals—most strongly predicted viral spread in this context.

### 1.1 Framing in Social Movements

Framing theory provides the conceptual foundation for understanding how movement actors construct meaning around contentious events. Following Entman's (1993) canonical definition, frames "select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation" (p. 52). In social movement contexts, framing processes are central to mobilization, as movement entrepreneurs must diagnose problems, propose solutions, and motivate collective action (Snow & Benford, 1988; Benford & Snow, 2000).

The framing literature distinguishes several frame functions relevant to protest communication. *Diagnostic framing* identifies problems and assigns blame—what we operationalize as INJUSTICE and CONFLICT frames. *Prognostic framing* proposes solutions and articulates visions—captured in our HOPE and CALL_TO_ACTION frames. *Motivational framing* provides rationales for engagement—reflected in SOLIDARITY and HUMANITARIAN frames. Finally, *informational framing* provides factual grounding that may support all three functions while maintaining epistemic rather than mobilizational orientation.

Gamson's (1992) influential work on collective action frames emphasized the "injustice component" as essential for mobilization, suggesting that content explicitly identifying victims and villains should resonate most strongly. This implies that INJUSTICE framing—explicitly assigning blame for wrongdoing—should predict higher engagement. However, Gamson also noted that injustice frames require credibility to be effective; unsubstantiated claims may backfire. In information-scarce environments, factual grounding may thus enhance rather than compete with emotional resonance.

### 1.2 Virality and Emotional Contagion

Research on content virality has increasingly emphasized the role of emotion in driving diffusion. Brady et al.'s (2017) influential study of moral contagion found that each moral-emotional word in a tweet increased its diffusion by approximately 20%, suggesting that moralized and emotional content spreads through social networks more readily than neutral content. Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan (2013) similarly found that emotionally charged political tweets were retweeted more frequently and quickly than neutral content.

This "emotional contagion" perspective implies clear predictions for protest content: frames emphasizing suffering (HUMANITARIAN), injustice (INJUSTICE), or conflict (CONFLICT) should outperform neutral, informational content. The arousal dimension of emotion—intensity rather than valence—appears particularly important; high-arousal content, whether positive or negative, spreads more readily than low-arousal content (Berger & Milkman, 2012).

However, the emotional contagion literature has primarily examined Western, English-language contexts with relatively stable information environments. Protest contexts marked by censorship, disinformation, and information scarcity may exhibit different dynamics. When audiences cannot trust official sources and face active disinformation campaigns, factual reporting and verification may acquire heightened value—what Tufekci (2017) describes as the "attention-scarcity" problem of networked protest.

### 1.3 The Information-Scarcity Hypothesis

We propose an alternative hypothesis grounded in crisis communication and information-seeking behavior. In high-uncertainty environments, audiences engage in active information seeking to reduce uncertainty and orient their understanding of rapidly evolving events (Spence et al., 2007). The #MahsaAmini movement emerged in an information environment characterized by:

1. **State censorship**: Iranian authorities restricted internet access and blocked social media platforms
2. **Active disinformation**: State media contested narratives about Amini's death and protest scale
3. **Transnational audiences**: Diaspora communities sought reliable information about events in Iran
4. **Rapid evolution**: Protests spread to new cities daily, creating demand for situational updates

In such contexts, informational content—factual updates, verified reports, contextual explainers—may serve critical orientation functions that drive sharing behavior. Users may share informational content not primarily for emotional expression but for instrumental purposes: helping their networks understand what is happening. This "information utility" motive for sharing (Lee & Ma, 2012) complements rather than contradicts emotional motives but may predominate in crisis contexts.

### 1.4 Research Questions and Hypotheses

Based on the preceding theoretical discussion, we pose one research question and three hypotheses:

**RQ1:** Which message frames are associated with higher viral engagement in the #MahsaAmini protest movement?

**H1 (Emotional Contagion):** Emotionally charged frames (INJUSTICE, CONFLICT, HUMANITARIAN) will show higher engagement than INFORMATIONAL framing.

**H2 (Arousal):** High-arousal content will show higher engagement than low-arousal content, regardless of frame.

**H3 (Solidarity Baseline):** SOLIDARITY framing, as the modal protest frame, will show baseline engagement levels rather than elevated engagement.

## 2. Method

### 2.1 Case Selection

The #MahsaAmini movement provides an ideal case for examining frame effects on virality for several reasons. First, the movement generated substantial Twitter activity across multiple languages (Persian, English, Arabic), enabling analysis of organic protest content rather than researcher-constructed stimuli. Second, the movement's rapid emergence and evolution created natural variation in framing strategies as different actors interpreted and responded to unfolding events. Third, the high-stakes, high-uncertainty context amplifies potential frame effects compared to routine political communication.

### 2.2 Sample

We analyzed 380 tweets posted between September 21 and October 3, 2022—the first two weeks following Mahsa Amini's death on September 16. Tweets were drawn from a larger dataset collected using the Twitter Academic Research API with the query `#MahsaAmini OR #مهسا_امینی` (the Persian hashtag).

**Data Context:** This dataset was originally part of a larger collection examining viral content across crisis contexts. The original 719-post dataset contained both #MahsaAmini content (n = 400) and Ukraine-related content (n = 319). During quality control, we discovered 20 Ukraine-related posts that had been erroneously included in the #MahsaAmini sample due to overlapping hashtag co-occurrence patterns. These contaminating posts were removed, yielding the final analytic sample of 380 posts. The Ukraine data form the basis of a separate ongoing study.

To ensure representation across the engagement distribution, we employed stratified sampling by engagement tier:
- **Viral** (top 5%): n = 105
- **High** (75th–95th percentile): n = 103
- **Medium** (25th–75th percentile): n = 93
- **Low** (bottom 25%): n = 79

This stratification enables examination of what distinguishes viral content from typical and low-engagement content, rather than analyzing only high-performing posts (a common limitation in virality research).

**Language distribution** reflected the movement's transnational character: Persian (69.2%), English (22.9%), Arabic (4.5%), and undefined (3.4%).

### 2.3 Dependent Variable: Composite Engagement

Following recommendations for handling count-based social media metrics (Bail, 2016), we constructed a composite engagement measure:

```
Engagement = log(retweets + 1) + log(likes + 1) + log(quotes + 1)
```

The log transformation addresses the characteristic right-skew of viral distributions while the +1 adjustment handles zero-engagement posts. This composite captures multiple engagement types (amplification via retweets, endorsement via likes, commentary via quotes) in a single metric.

**Descriptives:** Range 0.00–11.99, M = 2.05, SD = 2.40, Median = 1.10. The distribution exhibited expected right-skew (skewness = 1.73) with 20.8% zero-engagement posts.

### 2.4 Independent Variables

#### 2.4.1 Frame Typology

We developed a seven-frame typology drawing on social movement framing theory (Snow & Benford, 1988), crisis communication research (Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000), and protest communication literature (Freelon et al., 2018):

| Frame | Definition | Theoretical Grounding |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| **SOLIDARITY** | Unity, collective identity, shared struggle | Identity framing (Polletta & Jasper, 2001) |
| **INJUSTICE** | Wrongdoing with explicit perpetrator | Diagnostic framing (Gamson, 1992) |
| **CONFLICT** | Active clash between parties | News framing (Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000) |
| **HUMANITARIAN** | Suffering without perpetrator focus | Victim framing (Iyengar, 1991) |
| **HOPE** | Optimism, future vision, victory | Prognostic framing (Snow & Benford, 1988) |
| **INFORMATIONAL** | Neutral facts, updates, context | Information utility (Lee & Ma, 2012) |
| **CALL_TO_ACTION** | Appeals to act, share, participate | Motivational framing (Benford & Snow, 2000) |

#### 2.4.2 Emotional Arousal

Following the dimensional model of emotion (Russell, 1980), we coded emotional arousal as a three-level variable: low (calm, factual), medium (concerned, engaged), high (intense, urgent). Arousal captures emotional intensity independent of valence, consistent with findings that high-arousal content—whether positive or negative—spreads more readily (Berger & Milkman, 2012).

#### 2.4.3 Valence

We coded valence as positive, negative, or neutral. However, preliminary analysis revealed near-perfect confounding between frame and valence (e.g., CONFLICT and HUMANITARIAN were 100% negative; HOPE was 100% positive), precluding inclusion as an independent predictor.

### 2.5 Coding Procedure

Content was coded using the Communication Data Analyst Augmentation Framework (CommDAAF), a multi-model approach to LLM-assisted content analysis (see companion paper for detailed methodology). We employed three large language models representing different training regimes and cultural contexts: Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic, US), GLM-4.7 (Zhipu AI, China), and Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI, China). Each model independently coded all 380 posts following identical CommDAAF-compliant coding instructions that included explicit frame definitions, hierarchical decision rules for ambiguous cases, valence and arousal anchors with Persian/Arabic examples, and mixed-language handling guidance.

The full coding prompt expanded from initial simplified instructions (~100 words) to a comprehensive protocol (~2,500 words) after pilot testing revealed that underspecified prompts produced lower inter-model agreement. This iterative prompt development process is documented in detail in the companion methods paper.

Final coding was determined by majority vote (2/3 agreement). This multi-model approach offers several advantages: it provides a reliability metric analogous to inter-coder agreement, reduces single-model bias, enables examination of model-specific coding patterns, and leverages epistemic diversity across models trained on different corpora.

**Reliability:** Overall Fleiss' κ = 0.633, indicating substantial agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977). Three-way agreement was achieved for 58.2% of posts; majority agreement for 94.5%.

Frame-specific reliability varied: SOLIDARITY (66% three-way agreement), HOPE (65%), CALL_TO_ACTION (65%), INFORMATIONAL (50%), INJUSTICE (49%), HUMANITARIAN (45%), CONFLICT (33%). Lower reliability for CONFLICT, HUMANITARIAN, and INJUSTICE suggests these frames involve more interpretive judgment, a limitation we address in the discussion.

### 2.6 Analytical Strategy

We employed negative binomial regression given overdispersion in the engagement distribution (variance/mean = 2.79). The model specification:

```
Engagement ~ Frame + Arousal + ε
```

With SOLIDARITY (most prevalent frame) and low arousal as reference categories. We report incidence rate ratios (IRR) for interpretability: an IRR of 2.0 indicates that posts with a given frame receive twice the engagement of the reference category, holding other variables constant.

Supplementary OLS regression with HC3 robust standard errors yielded consistent substantive conclusions.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Frame Distribution

SOLIDARITY was the modal frame, comprising nearly one-third of coded posts (32.1%), consistent with the movement's emphasis on collective identity and transnational unity. CALL_TO_ACTION (18.2%) and INJUSTICE (12.9%) were next most prevalent, followed by HOPE (12.1%), HUMANITARIAN (11.1%), and INFORMATIONAL (8.9%). CONFLICT was least common (4.7%), possibly reflecting the movement's framing as popular uprising rather than two-sided conflict.

| Frame | n | % | Mean Engagement | SD |
|-------|---|---|-----------------|-----|
| SOLIDARITY | 122 | 32.1 | 1.73 | 2.28 |
| CALL_TO_ACTION | 69 | 18.2 | 1.83 | 2.69 |
| INJUSTICE | 49 | 12.9 | 2.41 | 2.34 |
| HOPE | 46 | 12.1 | 2.35 | 2.25 |
| HUMANITARIAN | 42 | 11.1 | 1.76 | 1.77 |
| INFORMATIONAL | 34 | 8.9 | 2.34 | 2.31 |
| CONFLICT | 18 | 4.7 | 3.48 | 2.96 |

### 3.2 Regression Results

Table 1 presents negative binomial regression results predicting composite engagement.

**Table 1. Negative Binomial Regression Predicting Viral Engagement**

| Predictor | IRR | 95% CI | z | p |
|-----------|-----|--------|---|---|
| (Intercept) | 1.24 | [0.89, 1.72] | 1.31 | .189 |
| HOPE | 1.51 | [0.87, 2.62] | 1.48 | .140 |
| CONFLICT | 1.89 | [0.84, 4.25] | 1.54 | .124 |
| HUMANITARIAN | 0.92 | [0.53, 1.59] | -0.29 | .773 |
| INJUSTICE | 1.38 | [0.79, 2.41] | 1.13 | .259 |
| **INFORMATIONAL** | **2.72** | **[1.52, 4.87]** | **3.42** | **<.001** |
| CALL_TO_ACTION | 0.89 | [0.53, 1.48] | -0.44 | .659 |
| Arousal: Medium | 1.35 | [0.94, 1.94] | 1.64 | .101 |
| **Arousal: High** | **1.58** | **[1.03, 2.43]** | **2.08** | **.038** |

*Note.* Reference categories: SOLIDARITY, low arousal. IRR = incidence rate ratio. N = 380.

**Key findings:**

1. **INFORMATIONAL framing showed the strongest effect** (IRR = 2.72, p < .001). Posts with informational framing received 2.72 times the engagement of SOLIDARITY posts, controlling for arousal. This contradicts H1 (emotional contagion hypothesis).

2. **High arousal predicted higher engagement** (IRR = 1.58, p = .038), supporting H2. Emotionally intense content spread more readily regardless of frame.

3. **SOLIDARITY showed baseline engagement**, supporting H3. Despite being the most prevalent frame, solidarity content did not exhibit elevated virality.

4. **CONFLICT showed a large but non-significant effect** (IRR = 1.89, p = .124). However, this estimate is unreliable due to small cell size (n = 18) and poor inter-model agreement (33% three-way). We report this for completeness but advise against substantive interpretation; the CONFLICT frame should be considered unmeasured in this study.

5. **Emotionally charged frames (INJUSTICE, HUMANITARIAN) did not outperform neutral content**, contrary to H1. HUMANITARIAN framing showed engagement indistinguishable from SOLIDARITY (IRR = 0.92, ns).

### 3.3 Effect Sizes

To facilitate comparison across frames, we calculated Cohen's d for each frame versus the SOLIDARITY reference category:

| Frame | d | Interpretation |
|-------|---|----------------|
| CONFLICT | 0.73 | Medium |
| INJUSTICE | 0.28 | Small |
| INFORMATIONAL | 0.25 | Small |
| HOPE | 0.26 | Small |
| CALL_TO_ACTION | 0.04 | Negligible |
| HUMANITARIAN | 0.01 | Negligible |

CONFLICT showed the largest effect size but unreliable estimation; INFORMATIONAL showed a small but statistically robust effect.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Information Over Emotion?

Our central finding challenges prevailing assumptions from moral contagion research: in the #MahsaAmini movement, informational framing—not emotional appeals—most strongly predicted viral engagement. Posts providing factual updates, contextual information, and neutral reporting received nearly three times the engagement of solidarity-focused content, controlling for emotional arousal.

This finding does not contradict emotional contagion theory but rather specifies its boundary conditions. Brady et al.'s (2017) moral contagion effects were observed in routine political communication where information is abundant and attention is scarce. The #MahsaAmini context inverted this dynamic: information was scarce (due to censorship and disinformation) while attention was abundant (due to dramatic events and emotional investment). In such contexts, informational content may acquire heightened sharing value precisely because it serves orientation functions that emotional content cannot.

We propose an **information-scarcity hypothesis**: in crisis contexts marked by censorship, disinformation, and rapid evolution, informational framing will outperform emotional framing because audiences prioritize orientation over expression. Users share informational content not to signal their emotions but to help their networks understand what is happening—a fundamentally different social function.

This interpretation aligns with research on information seeking during crises (Spence et al., 2007) and instrumental motivations for social media sharing (Lee & Ma, 2012). It also resonates with Tufekci's (2017) observation that networked movements face "attention" and "capacity" challenges—the abundance of emotional content may create demand for factual grounding.

### 4.2 Arousal Still Matters

While frames showed unexpected patterns, emotional arousal operated as theory predicts: high-arousal content spread more readily than low-arousal content (IRR = 1.58). This suggests a nuanced picture in which *what* is said (frame) and *how* it is said (arousal) exert independent effects.

Importantly, informational framing is not synonymous with low arousal. A post can provide factual information while conveying urgency and intensity—indeed, this combination may be particularly effective. The highest-engagement posts in our sample often combined informational content with high arousal: urgent updates about spreading protests, verified reports of violence, breaking news about international responses.

### 4.3 The Solidarity Paradox

SOLIDARITY framing was most prevalent (32%) yet showed only baseline engagement. This "solidarity paradox" has several possible explanations:

1. **Saturation effects**: In a protest context saturated with solidarity expression, individual solidarity posts may not stand out. The marginal value of another "We stand with Iranian women" post declines as such content becomes ubiquitous.

2. **Preaching to the choir**: Solidarity content may circulate within sympathetic networks but fail to bridge to new audiences. Informational content, by contrast, may appeal to information-seekers regardless of prior political orientation.

3. **Instrumentality**: Users may share solidarity content to express identity but share informational content to *do* something—help others understand events. The latter motivation may drive more active sharing behavior.

### 4.4 Implications for Social Movement Communication

These findings have practical implications for movement communicators. The emotional contagion literature might suggest that maximizing outrage, suffering, or solidarity would maximize spread. Our results suggest a more nuanced strategy: informational content that helps audiences understand rapidly evolving events may spread furthest, particularly when combined with high emotional arousal.

This does not mean movements should abandon emotional appeals—arousal remains a significant predictor. Rather, it suggests that emotional framing works best when grounded in factual reporting. The movement's iconic slogan "Woman, Life, Freedom" succeeded not by maximizing outrage but by articulating values with emotional resonance *and* clear meaning.

### 4.5 Limitations

Several limitations warrant caution in interpreting these findings:

**Frame reliability**: Three frames (CONFLICT, HUMANITARIAN, INJUSTICE) showed lower inter-model agreement (33-49%), suggesting these constructs are more difficult to code reliably. Findings related to these frames should be interpreted cautiously.

**Small cell sizes**: CONFLICT (n = 18) is too small for stable estimation. The large effect size (d = 0.73) is suggestive but confidence intervals are wide.

**Single platform**: Twitter may not be representative of broader communication dynamics. Instagram, Telegram, and TikTok played important roles in the #MahsaAmini movement and may exhibit different frame effects.

**Single case**: These findings may be specific to the #MahsaAmini context. Generalization requires replication across movements varying in information environment, platform, and cultural context.

**No human validation**: Content was coded by LLMs without human calibration. While multi-model agreement (κ = 0.633) provides an internal reliability check, it establishes consistency rather than validity. LLMs may agree on systematically incorrect interpretations. Human validation of a subsample would strengthen confidence that codes measure intended constructs. This limitation is inherent to the exploratory tier of CommDAAF; confirmatory publication would require human-validated coding.

**Causal interpretation**: Observational data cannot establish causality. Higher engagement with informational content may reflect audience preferences, algorithmic amplification, network position of information sharers, or other confounds. We cannot rule out that informational posts came disproportionately from high-follower accounts (e.g., journalists) whose content spreads due to network position rather than frame effects. Future work should control for follower count, account type, and prior engagement history.

**Missing network controls**: Engagement is heavily influenced by account characteristics not captured in our analysis. Without controlling for follower count, verified status, and account history, frame effects may be confounded with who posts which content.

### 4.6 Future Directions

These findings open several productive research directions:

1. **Cross-movement comparison**: Does the information-scarcity hypothesis hold across movements with varying information environments? Comparing movements with and without censorship would test this mechanism.

2. **Platform comparison**: Do frame effects differ across platforms with different affordances and audiences? Telegram's role as an alternative to Twitter in Iran suggests platform-specific dynamics.

3. **Temporal dynamics**: Do frame effects shift as movements evolve? Early phases may prioritize information; later phases may shift toward solidarity or action.

4. **Network analysis**: Do informational frames reach different audiences than emotional frames? Network-level analysis could reveal bridging versus bonding dynamics.

---

## 5. Conclusion

In the #MahsaAmini movement, informational framing predicted viral engagement more strongly than emotionally charged frames, challenging assumptions from moral contagion research. We propose that crisis contexts marked by information scarcity invert typical virality dynamics, elevating the sharing value of factual content. Emotional arousal remains important, but as a feature of *how* content is presented rather than *what* it says.

These findings contribute to framing theory by specifying boundary conditions for emotional contagion effects, and to social movement research by identifying conditions under which informational rather than emotional frames may mobilize attention. For movement practitioners, the implication is clear: in information-scarce environments, being a reliable source may matter more than being an emotional one.
